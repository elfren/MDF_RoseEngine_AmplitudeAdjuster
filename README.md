MDF Rose Engine Amplitude Adjuster

A simple amplitude adjuster for the MDF rose engine. It's fabricated from .375" aluminum flat stock. Slots in the base plate are sized to hold 1/4x20 bolts. It requires two .25" holes drilled in the side panels of the headstock. A 1/4x20 bolt is used as a pivot for the arm. A spacer (or locking collar) is used to position the arm on the bolt. The tower side uses two Ttracks to position the rubber. A carriage is used to keep the rubber horizontal while repositioning the rubber.

In use, the arm should be positioned parallel with the tower when the headstock is at top dead center and the rosette rubber is positioned at the mid-amplitude point of the rosette.
